# Mikes-Bikes


Mikes Bikes is a web page for anyone and everyone that rides motorcycles. It is for them so that they can share the bikes they own what they use them for and the modifications done to the bike so people can brows and see mods done to bikes like theirs to get ideas on what could be a good mod and what they could do to their bike.

I have made a navbar to go through the different type of bike to filter for the type of bikes you like Bikes, Street Bikes, Dirt Bikes, Electric Bikes, Cruiser Bikes, and My Bikes. 

On every page you can click the image of a bike to see the information on the bike why the user the posted the bike got it or how they ride weather they race or cruise.

Then if you go to My Bikes there are a couple different things you can do you can edit or delete a post. On My Bikes you can also Create a post and edit your profile.

If you go to edit or create it takes you to a new page both pages have a similar layout there are drop down menus for the type of bike and engine size if your in create they both say --Select-- and if you are in edit they are populated by the type and size you selected when you made the post. other then those drop down menus its just a text field for the user to fill out,

If you click profile it will let you edit your name and email. This is the basic usage of the site for now.
